# MorePizza-HashCode2020
Perfect score solution to the 2020 Google Hashcode practice problem 

# Hey y'all!
While practicing with my team for this year's practice problem, we actually managed to get down a pretty good solution:

I spent some time trying to add comments and make it more readable: ask me anything if the algorithm is not clear

# Notes
This is by no means just my creation: credit goes to both my team members <3
